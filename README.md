# Summary
This repository includes a single script, run_analysis.R, that merges data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project at the UCI Machine Learning Repository to produce averages values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and standard deviation measurements.

# How to use
Set the working directory to the folder containing the data. Run the script run_analysis.R. The script creates a output file called tidy.txt, which contains the aggregated data.
