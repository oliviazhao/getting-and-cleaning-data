The analysis generates an output file tidy.txt. The data includes all records from training data and test data in the activity recognition datasets.

The analysis follows the steps below:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
